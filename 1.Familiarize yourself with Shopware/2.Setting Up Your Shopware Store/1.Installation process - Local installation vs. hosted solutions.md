# Introduction

This module will guide you through a clean-slate installation process of essential tools and Shopware. We assume no software beyond essentials like Chrome is installed on your system. By the end of this module, you will have a functional Shopware installation on your local machine using DevEnv, a tool built on top of Nix.

 
## Installing essential tools : Visual Studio Code and iTerm2

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and iTerm2 are essential tools for development. VS Code serves as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), while iTerm2 provides access to the Unix-based command-line interface on macOS.

### Installing iTerm2

- Go to the [iTerm2 website](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html) > Navigate to the Downloads section > Download the latest stable version.

- Extract the downloaded .zip file

- Move the iTerm2 application to your Applications folder.

- Navigate to the Applications folder and double-click the iTerm2 icon to launch it.

### Installation of VS Code

The installation process for Visual Studio Code is similar to iTerm2. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the installation instructions.

## Installtion of Shopware

Next, we will install Shopware using DevEnv, a tool built on top of Nix.

### Understanding Nix and DevEnv

Nix is a powerful package manager for Unix-like operating systems that focuses on reproducible builds. DevEnv leverages Nix to rapidly set up development environments, automating the start of essential services like databases and web servers.

### Installing Nix

Open your terminal and run the following command to install Nix:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

### Optional: Installation of Zsh

Zsh is an optional tool to enhance your console's appearance and usability. If you wish to install it, explore further on your own.

### Installing Cachix

Cachix works with Nix to share and cache binary packages, significantly reducing build times.

#### Become a Trusted User:

Run this command to make yourself a trusted user:

```shell
echo "trusted-users = root ${USER}" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf && sudo pkill nix-daemon
```

#### Installation of Cachix

```shell
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
```

#### Use Cachix with Shopware

```shell
cachix use devenv
```

### Installation og DevEnv

With Nix and Cachix set up, install DevEnv with this command:

```shell
nix-env -iA devenv -f https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tarball/nixpkgs-unstable
```
 
### Setting Up Shopware

1. Install Necessary Packages for Composer:

```shell
nix-shell -p php82 php82Packages.composer
```

2. Create Shopware Project

```shell
composer create-project shopware/production <project-name>
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd <project-name>
```

4. Check if all the necessary folders are present within the Shopware directory:

```shell
ls -a
```

5. Install Devenv in the project

```shell
composer require devenv
```

6. Start Devenv Environment

```shell
devenv up
```

### Configuring Shopware

1. Check for Port Conflicts:

```shell
netstat -p tcp -van | grep '^Proto\|LISTEN'
```

 2. Edit the .env File:
Open the current folder in VS Code:

```shell
code .
```

3. Modify the DATABASE_URL in the .env file:

```shell
DATABASE_URL="mysql://shopware:shopware@127.0.0.1:3306/shopware?sslmode=disable&charset=utf8mb4"
```

4. Enter Devenv shell:

```shell
devenv shell
```

5. Access Shopware: Open localhost:8000/admin in your browser. The default username is admin and the password is shopware.

6. Configure Initial Settings:Follow the prompts to set up demo data, sales channels, and other initial configurations.
 
### Managing sales channel
 
To configure sales channels:

1. Add Domain:

- Navigate to the storefront configuration.

- Switch to http and use localhost:8000.

- Set the language, currency, and localization as needed.

- Save the configuration and refresh the storefront to see the changes.

### Extending Shopware

For further customization via plugins, apps, or themes:

Open Shopware File System in VS Code and refer to our [documentataion](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/)


### Stopping DevEnv

To stop DevEnv, return to the terminal where DevEnv is running and press Ctrl + C.

### Conclusion

You have successfully installed and configured Shopware on your local machine using DevEnv. You are now equipped to extend Shopware's functionality and start developing your projects. For further details and advanced configurations, refer to the official documentation and developer guides.
